                        <h4>An insight into gender inequalities through data sonification.</h4>

                        <p>
                            Invisible Walls is a sound and visual installation that offers a perceptive comprehension of genre inequalities by the immersion into a space where the visual boundaries, music and sound, are depicted, distorted and revealed by genre data.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Installation</h4>

                        <p> Data was collected (open access data from OCDE, INSEE, Eurostats and Audiens databases) and treated in order to reveal genre inequalities. Some of these data needed a statistical treatment towards the acquisition  of differentiating values between men and women in divers fields and situations (education, health, emploient, political representation). Other data represented already a measure of these inequalities. The values in this way obtained were then encoded on distinctive elements of a musical piece: sound distortion, effects, random patterns, in such a way that audio alteration follows the intensity of difference between mens and women.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Moving Surfaces</h4>

                        The data points used for the audio rendering are projected in real time by 4 projectors,
                        simultaneously to the distortions than they produce on the musical piece.
                        The projection is made over different surfaces (walls, tulle fabric, cardboard) and organizing using a mapping system.
                        The projective space is divided by "invisible walls" created from the tulle fabric, and from their multiplication  emerges perspective spaces.
                        The public is invited to wander in labyrinth-like space, the invisible walls reveal them self following the data projections.



                        <h4>Inside Data / Open Data</h4>

                        <p>
                        In this way, GLASS CEILINGS installation immerse the public into a both perceptive and thinking space, questioning about the origin of these data, their accessibility and effects.
                        The sonification of these permits to embody them into a abrupt sound material, questioning by their distortions.
                        </p>
